Start with your **motherboard and CPU** support: check whether you need DDR4 or DDR5. Then pick the right capacity for your use-case.

## Capacity

- **8 GB** – Light use, browsing, office.
- **16 GB** – Gaming and most daily use.
- **32 GB or more** – Heavy multitasking, content creation, or future-proofing.

## Speed and timings

Faster RAM (e.g. 3200 MHz vs 2666 MHz) can help in games and some apps, but only if your CPU and board support it. Enable XMP/EXPO in the BIOS after installing.

## Compatibility

Match the **form factor** (DIMM for desktop, SODIMM for laptop) and **generation** (DDR4 vs DDR5). Check your board’s QVL if you want to be sure.

When in doubt, use the manufacturer’s configurator or ask at PC Gilmore—we’ll help you pick the right kit.
