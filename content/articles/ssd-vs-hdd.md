**SSDs** are much faster for boot and apps; **HDDs** are cheaper for large storage. Many builds use both.

## SSD (Solid State Drive)

- Very fast load times and snappy system.
- No moving parts, so more durable and quiet.
- Best for: Windows, programs, games you play often.
- Cost: more per GB than HDD.

## HDD (Hard Disk Drive)

- Cheaper per GB, good for bulk storage.
- Slower; fine for backups, media, and archives.
- Best for: large files you don’t need to open every day.

## Recommendation

Use an **SSD for your main drive** (at least 256 GB, ideally 500 GB or more) and add an **HDD** if you need lots of space for photos, videos, or backups. We can help you choose the right combo at PC Gilmore.
